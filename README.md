# 🍲 Recipe Finder

This is my first web development project — a simple recipe search app using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It lets users type an ingredient (like *chicken* or *eggplant*) and find related recipes using **TheMealDB API**.

## ✨ Features
- Search for recipes by keyword
- Real-time results from TheMealDB
- Clean and simple UI
- Beginner-friendly and fully front-end

## 📁 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/)

## 💡 Inspiration
I was inspired by YouTube tutorials and wanted to build something small to practice API fetching and web design basics.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
